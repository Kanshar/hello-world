# hello-world
## follow-along guides - github
Intended to be a repository for reference guides to tools, utilities, APIs. 
It could be pointers to good references as well, though a bit more detailed than a bookmark.
The documentation should help me get back to speed even when the tool is not used for a while, e.g. github.
